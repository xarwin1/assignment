            <p>Dear Mrs. Jabelle,<br><br><br><br>
                I want to take a moment to express my appreciation to your perseverance and patience to educate, give inspiration,
                and hope to your beloved students. You make our day everytime you tell us those <del>cheesy</del> funny jokes. I am really amazed on how do you manage to stay alive when you are managing such a <ins>horrendous</ins> section. We are really sorry if we let you down almost everytime. We are not perfect, but I can see me and my classmates trying to be better to stop <i>adding salt to your wound</i>.
                <br><br>
                Thank you Mrs. Jabelle for educating us, your dedication, and kindness inspire all of us. Keep being you and don't forget to take a rest when things are getting tiring.
            <p class="ending">With kind regards,<br>Xarwin</p>
            </p>
